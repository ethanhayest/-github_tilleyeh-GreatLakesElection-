2024 Presidential Election in the Great Lakes Map
This map shows the 2024 U.S. Presidential election results for the Great Lakes states. The great lake states are a contested part of the country so I thought it would be interesting to make a map about this area of the election.The map, which I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using Leaflet.js), allows people viewing the map to see each stateâ€™s election result via color-coded shading. I found the data from the Associated press website which takes all of the polling data and compiles it for users to view. I took this data and then used Google maps to create points to shade in. Then I used the new data to put into VS code. 
Features
Interactive Map: Users can click on each state to view the percentage each candidate won.
Color-Coded Choropleth: Dark, medium, and light hues of red and blue indicate the level of support for each candidate.
Detailed Legend: A color-coded legend positioned on the center left side of the map explains the shading.
Setup
Open index.html in a browser.
Make sure internet connection is available to load Leaflet.js from the CDN.
Files
index.html: Contains the HTML structure, Leaflet.js map, and JavaScript logic.
