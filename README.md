2024 Presidential Election in the Great Lakes Map
This map shows the 2024 U.S. Presidential election results for the Great Lakes states. The map, which I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using Leaflet.js), allows people viewing the map to see each stateâ€™s election result via color-coded shading. The great lake states are a contested part of the country so I thought it would be intresting to make a map about this area of the election.
